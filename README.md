### Requirements
- Qt 6.x runtime libraries (dynamically linked)

### How to Run
1. Install the Qt runtime libraries for your platform.
2. Build the project using CMake. -> You may need the dlls which you can generate in windows by using "QTDIR/bin/windeployqt.exe"
3. Run the `ClipTrack` executable.

(Or you open it with VS)

Its my first serious C++/Qt file, so don't expect it to be perfect.
